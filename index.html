                    I am a game designer who also has confident skills in game coding, and is eager to tackle dynamic
                    challenges and
                    apply creativity
                    to craft entertaining player experiences. I have proficiency in project management, user-centric
                    problem-solving,
                    and seamless collaboration across teams as well as independently. I have experience in several game
                    development
                    processes,
                    such as design, development, and 3D modeling, as well as other fields, like web and software
                    development.
