                    <p>
                        Honestly, the true start of my journey into game design was when I was a kid. 
                        I actually have my grandmother to thank for introducing me to the world of gaming.
                        She was a huge fan of hidden object games and the Traveller's Tales Lego games,
                        and would often let me play them with her while I'd spend the summer at her house. 
                        I remember being fascinated by the worlds and stories in those games, and it sparked a 
                        curiosity in me about how they were made. As I got older, I wasn't sure what I wanted to do 
                        with my life, but I always had a love for games and storytelling. It wasn't until I realized that
                        I could actually make the kinds of games I had so many fond memories of that I decided to pursue 
                        game design and development.

                        I knew that when I wanted to pursue a career in games, that I would be a game designer first and foremost.
                        Being at the reigns and being able to push my own creative vision was something that I knew 
                        I wanted to be able to do. I just have so many ideas that I want the world to experience, 
                        and I want to be able to share those ideas in the most direct way possible - Games.

                        <br>
                        During my academic career as a student in a games program, I have had the opportunity to create and lead many game projects, 
                        both solo and in teams. In most, I took the role of either game designer or developer. And in some, I took on both roles. 
                        I have experience in designing and developing games across a variety of genres, including puzzle games, shooters, and narrative-driven games.
                        I have worked best in indie teams, as getting to collaborate with others who have different skillsets and perspectives is 
                        something that I really enjoy and find the most effective for outputting polished games with a clear vision, though I am capable
                        of working solo as well.

                        When first realizing that I wanted to work in the games industry, I also knew that I wanted to learn everything
                        about everything that goes into making games. I wanted to be able to understand the entire process, 
                        from concept to completion, and be able to contribute in any way possible. So in school, that is what I am striving to do.
                        I decided that a great way to do this was to learn how to code, as I had no prior experience with coding before 
                        starting at Miami. I have since become proficient in web development coding (this very site was made by scratch by me!), 
                        Java, C#, C++, and have experience with several game engines, including Unity and Unreal Engine.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Since my time at college, I have developed a strong understanding of game mechanics, 
                        player psychology, and user experience design. I am passionate about creating games that 
                        are not only fun to play but also meaningful and impactful for players.
